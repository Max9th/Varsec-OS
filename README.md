# Credits

Thanks to popcar2 and the rest of the Godot OS team. Godot OS was an inspiration for this project. Window-related logic was inspired on their code

Thanks to the creators of [You spin me round (like a record)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Spin_Me_Round_(Like_a_Record)) and [Before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Fwx_Nx-nlY&list=RD0Fwx_Nx-nlY&start_radio=1&rv=8n0d4kirCQY). Their songs were used in the project

Thanks to the creators of the godot plugins Gdfxr, Script Tabs, and Tnowe Extra Controls.

Thanks to the creator of the [Computer Startup Sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kRqai4ZbHA) and [Coding Tic-Tac-Toe, on nostalgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG6M-vt-4JY&t=1502s) for the computer sound effects

Thanks to my art teacher and to my physics teacher for their cameos in the OS

And finally, thanks to the Godot Community for being helpful 

(I still plan on adding credits for the creators of the shaders used in the project)
